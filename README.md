# Hi there 👋 I'm Shadrack Osike!

A Junior Developer on a learning adventure 🚀. I'm also currently navigating the exciting world of being a student 📚.

They say I'm quite the charismatic fellow. In fact, I once convinced a group of pigeons in the park that I was their leader. Sadly, my attempts at flight were less successful. 🐦😂

Always eager to connect and collaborate, so feel free to reach out! Let's build something awesome together! 🤝
