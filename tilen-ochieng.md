Hi! I'm an IT student under the engineering cohort at the Technical University of Mombasa.  
I'm passionate about software development, especially backend systems using React JS, Node JS and Python.  
During this attachment, I hope to learn team collaboration, improve my coding skills, and contribute to real-world tech solutions.
